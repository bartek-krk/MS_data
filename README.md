Mossbauer absorption spectrum analysis of 57Fe/oxyhaemoglobin.
### About project
- Mossbauer spectroscopy lab for AGH UST Biomedical Engineering students
- Day performed: 3 march 2020  

This repository includes a .csv file of 256 channel values with their respective count numbers (or velocity in OXY) measured using autonomous time impulse analyzer 'MOSIEK' during Mossbauer spectroscopy lab, which is a part of Biophysics course for Biomedical Engineering students at AGH UST. The data is loaded to a Python script and proceeded in order to obtain appropiate plots and fit a sum of 6 Lorentz curves (or 2 in OXY) representing the absorbtion spectrum of 57Fe (oxyhaemoglobin). Those data were later used in a report handed to the teacher, which is beyond the concern of this repository.
